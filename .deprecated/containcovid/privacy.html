      <li><b><span class="text__privacy">Provision of the website and creation of logfiles</span></b>
        <p>Whenever our website is accessed, our servers and applications record automated data and information from the accessing computer’s system.</p>
        <p>The following data is temporarily recorded:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your IP address</li>
          <li>Date and time of your access to the page</li>
          <li>Address of the page accessed</li>
          <li>Address of the website just visited (referrer)</li>
          <li>Name and version of your browser/operating system (if communicated)</li>

        <p></p>
        <p>The data are stored in our system logfiles. These data are not stored together with the user’s other personal data.</p>
        <p>The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data and the logfiles is Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. The data are stored in logfiles to ensure the operability of the website. In addition, the data help us to optimize the web pages, to eliminate faults and to ensure the security of our information system technology. These purposes also constitute our legitimate interest in the data processing in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) of the Regulation.</p>
        <p>The data are deleted once they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were recorded. Where data are recorded in order to make the website available, they are deleted at the end of the session in question. Where the data are stored in logfiles, they are deleted at the latest after seven days. A longer storage is possible, but in this case users’ IP addresses are deleted or distorted so that the accessing client can no longer be identified.</p>
        <p>The recording of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in logfiles is essential for the operation of the website. Hence the user cannot object to this recording.</p>
