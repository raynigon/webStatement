  <p class="statement statement__plain">Across Europe, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is causing excess deaths, placing a burden on societies and health systems, and harming the economy. Yet, European governments still have to develop a common vision to guide the management of the pandemic. Overwhelming evidence shows that not only public health, but also society and the economy benefit greatly from low COVID-19 case numbers. Vaccines will help control the virus, but not until late 2021. If we do not act now, further waves of infection are to be expected, with consequential further damage to health, society, jobs and businesses. Given open borders within Europe, a single country alone cannot keep the number of COVID-19 cases low; thus joint action and common goals among countries are essential. We, therefore, call for a strong, coordinated European response and clearly defined medium- and long-term goals.</p>

  <p class="statement statement__plain">Achieving and maintaining low case numbers should be the common, pan-European goal because:</p>

  <p><span class="statement statement__plain">To better manage the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose a strategy with three core elements:</span></p>

  <div class="container-fluid padding">
    <div class="row text-center">
      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <b><span class="statement statement__plain">Achieve low case numbers.</span></b>
          <ol type='i' class="list-minor">
            <li><span class="statement statement__plain">Aim for a target of 10 new COVID-19 cases or less per million people per day. This target has already been reached in many countries, and can be reached again throughout Europe by spring, at the latest.</span></li>
            <li><span class="statement statement__plain">Take firm action to reduce case numbers quickly. Strong interventions have proven efficient, and balance the rapid achievement of low case numbers against the negative impact of the interventions on mental health and the economy.</span></li>
            <li><span class="statement statement__plain">To avoid a ping-pong effect by importing and reimporting SARS-CoV-2 infections, the reduction should be synchronized across all European countries and start as soon as possible. This synchronization will allow European borders to stay open.</span></li>
          </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <b><span class="statement statement__plain">Keep case numbers low.</span></b>
          <ol type='i' class="list-minor">
            <li><span class="statement statement__plain">At low case numbers, restrictions may be eased, but this should be carefully monitored. Targeted mitigation measures, such as mask wearing, hygiene, contact regulation and TTIS will be continued and improved.</span></li>
            <li><span class="statement statement__plain">Even if case numbers are low, a strategy for surveillance testing (of at least 300 tests per million people per day) should be in place, covering the most important population groups at risk so that an increase in case numbers  can be detected in time.</span></li>
            <li><span class="statement statement__plain">Local outbreaks require a rapid and rigorous response, including travel restrictions, targeted testing, and possibly regional lockdowns, to achieve a rapid reduction in prevalence.</span></li>
          </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <b><span class="statement statement__plain">Develop a longer-term common vision.</span></b>
          <p><span class="statement statement__plain">Develop context-sensitive regional and national action plans as well as European-level goals, depending on the COVID-19 prevalence. Develop strategies for elimination, screening, vaccination, protection of those at high risk, and support for those most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic <a href='#references'>[9]</a>.</span><p>

  <p><span class="statement statement__plain statement__plain__highlight">It is crucial to clearly communicate the advantage of low SARS-CoV-2 incidence. </span><span class="statement statement__plain">The success of these measures depends crucially on the cooperation and involvement of the public. Making the case for the economic and social benefits of reducing case numbers will, if clearly communicated, greatly foster public cooperation.</span></p>

  <p><span class="statement statement__plain statement__plain__highlight">Controlling COVID-19 will become easier: </span><span class="statement statement__plain">In the near future, increased immunization, more testing, and an improved understanding of mitigation strategies will further facilitate the control of SARS-CoV-2.</span></p>

  <p><span class="statement statement__plain">We urge governments throughout Europe to agree on clearly formulated common goals, to coordinate their efforts, to develop regionally-adapted strategies to reach the goals, and thereby work resolutely towards low SARS-CoV-2 case numbers.</span></p>
