To avoid a ping-pong effect of exportation and reimportation of cases among countries, and still enjoy our freedom of movement, we need a common European vision and a shared commitment to lower the number of cases, and keep it low.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header card_header__interview" id="headingTwo"><h5 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link float-left collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo"><i class="fas fa-angle-down float-left rotate-icon"></i><span class="interview interview__card">Why the goal of 10 daily new infected per million people?</span></button></h5></div><div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" data-parent="#accordion"><div class="card-body"><p><span class="interview interview__author">[Viola Priesemann]:</span> <span class="interview interview__plain">This number marks a goal, not a strict upper limit. But why precisely a goal of ten?</span></p><ul><li class="interview interview__plain">First, in our quantitative studies [1,2], a large range of parameters lead to stable dynamics at 10 or less daily new infections per million people - or it shows exponential growth. The parameter range for which one obtains high but still stable case numbers is very narrow, and thus not realistic.</li><li class="interview interview__plain">Second, about 10 new cases are roughly within the health authorities test and contact-tracing capacity, at least in Germany.</li><li class="interview interview__plain">Third, if surpassed, then one still has some time before reaching strict limits of about 50 daily new cases. This safety-margin enables policy makers to prepare the necessary actions without haste should the numbers grow.</li><li class="interview interview__plain">Fourth, if all neighboring regions reduce their case numbers by a factor 2, then your own region will automatically reduce its case numbers by a factor 2 as well - if behavior is not changed. This sounds like magic? No, it is the synergistic effects of low case numbers across Europe; or we can call it simple math: The stability level of new cases N, is determined mainly by two factors, namely the influx F of new infections from abroad, and the effective reproduction number R: N = F/(1-R)</li></ul><span class="interview interview__plain">This simple formula clearly states: If case numbers are low in your neighboring regions, then the influx of new cases F is low, and your own region also will have low case numbers â€“ and vice versa. Hence, due to the open borders, everyone jointly profits from low case numbers; in contrast, high case numbers in some region put the stability of their neighbors at risk.</span><p></p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header card_header__interview" id="headingThree"><h5 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link float-left collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree"><i class="fas fa-angle-down float-left rotate-icon"></i><span class="interview interview__card">Why is this still relevant although vaccines have already been developed?</span></button></h5></div><div id="collapseThree" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree" data-parent="#accordion"><div class="card-body"><p><span class="interview interview__author">[Matjaz Perc, physics]:</span> <span class="interview interview__plain">Although vaccines have been developed, it is unlikely that sufficient coverage will be achieved in due time to ensure herd immunity before the second wave fully tapers off or even before a potential third wave starts in Europe. Assuming that COVID-19 is as contagious as influenza, a vaccination coverage of 30-75% of the population would be needed for herd immunity. Taking current resources into account, not just in terms of vaccine availability, but also in terms of the availability of human resources needed to run such a large-scale vaccination program, it is virtually impossible that a sufficiently high vaccination coverage will be achieved for Europe to be able to abandon other measures for mitigating COVID-19 infections.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header card_header__interview" id="headingFour"><h5 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link float-left collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseFour"><i class="fas fa-angle-down float-left rotate-icon"></i><span class="interview interview__card">How can one avoid a third wave, or a series of lockdowns?</span></button></h5></div><div id="collapseFour" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingFour" data-parent="#accordion"><div class="card-body"><p><span class="interview interview__author">[Matjaz Perc, physics]:</span> <span class="interview interview__plain">Job one at this point is to get the current numbers of active cases down across Europe. Then we have to remain vigilant, so that whenever new cases start to emerge, we are prepared to act fast and resolutely. This will prevent a third wave, as well as keep lockdowns geographically and time-wise limited.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header card_header__interview" id="headingFive"><h5 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link float-left collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseFive" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseFive"><i class="fas fa-angle-down float-left rotate-icon"></i><span class="interview interview__card">What is the cost and the benefit of contact tracing?</span></button></h5></div><div id="collapseFive" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingFive" data-parent="#accordion"><div class="card-body"><p><span class="interview interview__author">[Giulia Giordano, dynamical systems]:</span> <span class="interview interview__plain">The benefit of contact tracing is fundamental: once an infected has been detected, it is crucial to isolate and test all the people with whom the infected person has come into contact, so as to break as soon as possible the contagion chain. Of course, it comes at a cost: a dedicated infrastructure, including people and resources, is needed to trace contacts, while tracing apps may raise privacy issues. Also, testing and tracing works well only when the case numbers are low enough: the infrastructure cannot cope with huge case numbers. However, by testing and tracing, outbreaks can be early detected and suppressed, allowing us to live a more normal life in spite of the pandemic.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header card_header__interview" id="headingSix"><h5 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link float-left collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseSix" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseSix"><i class="fas fa-angle-down float-left rotate-icon"></i><span class="interview interview__card">What is the minimum number of daily tests required to control the pandemic?</span></button></h5></div><div id="collapseSix" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingSix" data-parent="#accordion"><div class="card-body"><p><span class="interview interview__author">[Giulia Giordano, dynamical systems]:</span> <span class="interview interview__plain">One could argue that a golden target would be, for instance, 5000 tests per million people per day. Actually, it would be reasonable to dynamically adjust the number of daily tests depending on the ratio between positive tests and total number of tests: if this ratio is too high, let's say above 5%, this is an indication that we should be testing much more, so as to prevent the pandemic from going out of control.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header card_header__interview" id="headingSeven"><h5 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link float-left collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseSeven" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseSeven"><i class="fas fa-angle-down float-left rotate-icon"></i><span class="interview interview__card">What are strategies for an efficient suppression of cases?</span></button></h5></div><div id="collapseSeven" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingSeven" data-parent="#accordion"><div class="card-body"><p><span class="interview interview__author">[Matjaz Perc, physics]:</span> <span class="interview interview__plain">Throughout history, we have attempted to stop epidemics by means of community lockdowns. Be it the shutting down of infected family houses during the mid 14th century plague pandemic, or the lockdown of different residential areas across major Chinese cities during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. But research shows that community lockdowns are effective only if the links outside of the communities are truly completely sealed off. The benefits are inferable only beyond 90% lockdown effectiveness. And even then the peak of the infected curve decreases by only 20% and its onset is delayed only by a factor of 1.5. The complex connectedness of modern human societies, which enables the ease of global communication and the lightning speeds at which news and information spread, also makes it very difficult to halt epidemic spreading with top-down measures, such as community lockdowns. What actually works, and what we should be aspiring to, is bottom-up endogenous self-isolation and social distancing. Unfortunately, the later can not be as easily imposed or controlled as top-down measures, but they are absolutely crucial for an efficient suppression of cases. In the absence of this everything else, such as shutting down public transport, schools, restaurants, and factories, is ultimately bound to fail. But this is not to say that we do not need top-down measures -- we do need them, but under the understanding that they enable us to enact what actually works, which is self-isolation and social distancing.</span></p><p><span class="interview interview__author">[Giulia Giordano, dynamical systems]: </span><span class="interview interview__plain">I believe the best strategy is a wise combination of physical distancing (such as targeted lockdowns), which is indispensable to drastically lower case numbers, and of widespread testing and contact tracing, which is fundamental to keep case numbers low [3]. Of course, individual responsibility, hygiene, use of masks and reduction of non-indispensable contacts are fundamental all the time.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header card_header__interview" id="headingEight"><h5 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link float-left collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseEight" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseEight"><i class="fas fa-angle-down float-left rotate-icon"></i><span class="interview interview__card">Is elimination possible?</span></button></h5></div><div id="collapseEight" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingEight" data-parent="#accordion"><div class="card-body"><p><span class="interview interview__author">[Eva Schernhammer, Epidemiology]:</span> <span class="interview interview__plain">Eliminating an infectious disease i.e. global eradication has hardly ever happened in our history (smallpox); but controlling the pandemic is likely possible, even if seasonality and the need for updated vaccines each year emerge for COVID-19. But with adequate political as well as societal support, a suitable vaccine, as well as other factors, eradication of COVID-19 is theoretically also possible.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header card_header__interview" id="headingNine"><h5 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link float-left collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseNine" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseNine"><i class="fas fa-angle-down float-left rotate-icon"></i><span class="interview interview__card">Isn't the economic burden of another lockdown too high?</span></button></h5></div><div id="collapseNine" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingNine" data-parent="#accordion"><div class="card-body"><p><span class="interview interview__author">[Matjaz Perc, physics]:</span> <span class="interview interview__plain">If the currently ongoing second COVID-19 wave across Europe has taught us anything it is that it definitively does not pay off to wait with lockdowns because the economy will suffer. This was the argument in many EU countries, including in Slovenia, i.e., let us wait a bit with the measures until the summer season is ongoing. But the price we are all paying now, and certainly not just in economic terms, is much higher than whatever we have saved in those 2-3 weeks when a lockdown was long due but postponed due to economic reasons.</span></p><p><span class="interview interview__author">[Giulia Giordano, dynamical systems]:</span> <span class="interview interview__plain">We have two choices. First: we act immediately and then we release the lockdown once case numbers are low enough. Second: we postpone, until the lockdown becomes inevitable due to saturation of hospitals and intensive care units, and unbearable numbers of daily deaths. In both cases, the economic burden is comparable - and may be even worse in the second case, because the lockdown needs to last much longer if it starts when the number of cases is huge. But a prompt intervention drastically reduces healthcare costs and saves many lives.</span></p></div></div></div></div><div class="container-fluid padding container__references"><a id="statement__references"><h2>References</h2></a><div id="list__references"><ul style="list-style: none;"><li><span class="ref ref__number">[1] </span><span class="ref ref__title"><a class="ref__title-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05732" target="_blank">The challenges of containing SARS-CoV-2 via test-trace-and-isolate</a>, </span><span class="ref ref__year">Nat.
